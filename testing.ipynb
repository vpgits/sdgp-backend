      "Object Oriented Principles we saw so far•EncapsulationIt keeps the data and the code safe from external interference. It is a mechanism for restricting direct access to some of the object’s component. Binding the data with the code that manipulates it.•InheritanceInheritance allows a class to use the properties and methods of another class. In other words, the derived class inherits the states and behaviors from the base class.•Polymorphism.Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Java Inheritance Tree •All Java classes you ever use or write yourself are in the inheritance tree with class Object at the top: ObjectStringEverything elseShapeSquare \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything is an Object Object obj = new Square() ; • OK •But can only call methods declared by class Object. •Of course, they may be overridden by subclasses. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Object Class•Every java class has Object as its superclass and thus inherits the Object methods.•Object is a non-abstract class (You will see in a few slides the meaning of Abstract class)•Many Object methods, however, have implementations that aren’t particularly useful in general•In most cases, it is a good idea to override these methods with more useful versions.•In other cases, it is required if you want your objects to correctly work with other class libraries.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Some Object Class methods •Object methods of interest:–equals–hashcode–toString•Other object methods–getClass–wait, notify, notifyAll (relevant for threaded programming) \n",

      "toString() method•The Object method String toString(); is intended to return a readable textual representation of the object upon which it is called. This is great for debugging!•Best way to think of this is using a print statement. If we execute: System.out.println(someObject); \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Final keyword – Final Variables•Public static variables are often used to create symbolic constants. – E.g., Math.PI (static variable PI in class Math) •Such variables are additionally declared final: – public static final double PI = 3.141; •The value of a final variable cannot be changed by assignment. \n",

      "\n",
      "Final classespublic final class X { } The final keyword can be used:•to prevent inheritance, as final class cannot be extended•to create an immutable class like the predefined String class. You can not make a class immutable without making it final.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Final methods• Declaring a method “final” stops it being overridden: public final void doSomething() { doThis() ; ... // Whatever doThat() ; }•doThis and doThat can be overridden but not doSomething. •A constructor cannot be final\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Why use final? •Gives the class programmer control. •Not all classes or methods are designed to be subclassed or overridden. •Can explicitly enforce design decisions. \n",

      "Abstract Method•Methods that are declared, with no implementation•You can declare an object without defining it:Person p;•Similarly, you can declare a method without defining it:public abstract void draw(int size);–Notice that the body of the method is missing–There is only the signature (a method signature is part of the method declaration. It's the combination of the method name and the parameter list)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Abstract classes•Any class containing an abstract method is an abstract class•You must declare the class with the keyword abstract:abstract class MyClass {...}•An abstract class is incomplete–It has “missing” method bodies•You cannot instantiate (create a new instance of) an abstract class. But it can provide a constructor!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Abstract classes•You can extend (subclass) an abstract class–If the subclass defines all the inherited abstract methods, it is “complete” and can be instantiated–If the subclass does not define all the inherited abstract methods, it must be abstract too•You can declare a class to be abstract even if it does not contain any abstract methods–This prevents the class from being instantiated\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Examplepublic abstract class Animal { abstract String eat(); abstract void breathe();}•This class cannot be instantiated•Any non-abstract subclass of Animal must provide the eat() and breathe() methods\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Why abstract classes?•Suppose you wanted to create a class Shape, with subclasses Square, Rectangle, Triangle, etc.•You don’t want to allow creation of a “Shape”–Only particular shapes make sense, not generic ones–If Shape is abstract, you can’t create a new Shape–You can create a new Square, a new Rectangle, etc.•Abstract classes are good for defining a general category containing specific, “concrete” classes \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A problem if we not use Abstract classclass Shape { ... }class Star extends Shape { void draw() { ... } ...}class Square extends Shape { void draw() { ... } ...}Shape someShape = new Star();someShape.draw();Remember: A class knows its superclass, but not its subclassesThis is legal, because a Star is a Shape This is a syntax error, because someShape might not have a draw() method It is not abstract and it does not have draw() method \n",

      "Interfaces•An interface declares (describes) methods but does not supply bodies for them interface KeyListener { public abstract void keyPressed(KeyEvent e); public abstract void keyReleased(KeyEvent e); public abstract void keyTyped(KeyEvent e);}•All the methods are implicitly public and abstract–You can add these qualifiers if you like, but why bother?•You cannot instantiate an interface–An interface is like a very abstract class—none of its methods are defined•An interface may also contain constants (final variables)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Define interface•To distinguish an interface from a class, Java uses the following syntax to define an interface:public interface InterfaceName { constant declarations; method signatures;}Example:public interface Edible { /** Describe how to eat */ public abstract String howToEat();}\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Implements Interface•When you say a class implements an interface, you are promising to define all the methods that were declared in the interface•Example:class MyKeyListener implements KeyListener { public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e) {...}; public void keyReleased(KeyEvent e) {...}; public void keyTyped(KeyEvent e) {...};}–The “...” indicates actual code that you must supply\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Partially implementing an Interface•It is possible to define some but not all of the methods defined in an interface:abstract class MyKeyListener implements KeyListener { public void keyTyped(KeyEvent e) {...};}•Since this class does not supply all the methods it has promised, it is an abstract class•You must label it as such with the keyword abstract•You can even extend an interface (to add methods):–interface FunkyKeyListener extends KeyListener { ... }\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s the difference between an interface and an abstract class?•An interface cannot implement any methods, whereas an abstract class can•A class can implement many interfaces but can have only one superclass (abstract or not)•An interface is not part of the class hierarchy. Unrelated classes can implement the same interface\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Why are they useful?•By leaving certain methods undefined, these methods can be implemented by several different classes, each in its own way. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What about inheritance?•An abstract class can’t inherit from more than one other class. (In java multiple inheritance is not allowed! In C++ it is!)•Interfaces can inherit from other interfaces, and a single interface can inherit from multiple other interfaces\n",

      "Template Method Pattern•Intent/Problem: Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to client subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.•Solution: The component designer decides which steps of an algorithm are invariant (or standard), and which are variant (or customizable). The invariant steps are implemented in an abstract base class, while the variant steps are either given a default implementation, or no implementation at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Template Method Pattern The key point to mention is that template method should be final, so that subclass can not override and change steps of the algorithm, but same time individual step should be abstract, so that child classes can implement them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Example Suppose to create a data mining application that analyzes corporate documents. Users feed the app documents in various formats (PDF, DOC, CSV), and it tries to extract meaningful data from these docs in a uniform format.\n",
