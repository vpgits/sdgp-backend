It began in the late 1960s and early\\n1970s as an experimental US Department of Defense project called ARPANET\\n(Advanced Research Projects Agency NETwork) investigating how to build networks\\nthat could withstand partial outages (like nuclear bomb attacks) and still survive.\\nIn 1982, TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) was adopted\\nas the standard communications protocols for ARPANET. TCP is responsible for\\nensuring correct delivery of messages that move from one computer to another.\\nIP manages the sending and receiving of packets of data between machines,\\nbased on a four-byte destination address (the IP number), which is assigned to\\nan organization by the Internet authorities. The term TCP/IP sometimes refers\\nto the entire Internet suite of protocols that are commonly run on TCP/IP, such\\nas FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), Telnet\\n(Telecommunication Network), DNS (Domain Name Service), POP (Post Office\\nProtocol), and so on.\\nIn the process of developing this technology, the military forged strong links with\\nlarge corporations and universities. As a result, responsibility for the continuing\\nresearch shifted to the National Science Foundation (NSF) and, in 1986, NSFNET\\n(National Science Foundation NETwork) was created, forming the new backbone\\nof the network. Under the aegis of the NSF, the network became known as the\\nInternet. However, NSFNET itself ceased to form the Internet backbone in 1995,\\nand a fully commercial system of backbones has been created in its place. The cur-\\nrent Internet has been likened to an electronic city with virtual libraries, storefronts,\\nbusiness offices, art galleries, and so on.\\nAnother term that is popular, particularly with the media, is the “Information\\nSuperhighway.” This is a metaphor for the future worldwide network that will pro-\\nvide connectivity, access to information, and online services for users around the\\nworld. The term was first used in 1993 by then–Vice President Al Gore in a speech\\noutlining plans to build a high-speed national data communications network, of\\nwhich the Internet is a prototype. In his book The Road Ahead, Bill Gates (chairman\\nand co-founder of Microsoft) likens the building of the Information Superhighway\\nto the building of the national highway system in the United States, where the\\nInternet represents the starting point in the construction of a new order of net-\\nworked communication (Gates, 1995).\\nThe Internet began with funding from the NSF as a means to allow American uni-\\nversities to share the resources of five national supercomputing centers. Its numbers\\nof users quickly grew as access became cheap enough for domestic users to have their\\nown links on PCs. By the early 1990s, the wealth of information made freely available\\non this network had increased so much that a host of indexing and search services\\nsprang up to answer user demand such as Archie, Gopher, Veronica, and WAIS (Wide\\nArea Information Service), which provided services through a menu-based interface.\\nIn contrast, the Web uses hypertext to allow browsing, and a number of Web-based\\nsearch engines were created, such as Google, Yahoo!, and MSN.\\nFrom initially connecting a handful of nodes with ARPANET, the Internet was\\nestimated to have over 100 million users in January 1997.† One year later, the [/INST]  {\\n\"key_points\": [\\n\"The Internet was originally developed as a means for American universities to share the resources of five national supercomputing centers.\",\\n\"It began in the late 1960s and early 1970s as an experimental US Department of Defense project called ARPANET.\",\\n\"TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) was adopted as the standard communications protocols for ARPANET in 1982.\",\\n\"The term TCP/IP sometimes refers to the entire Internet suite of protocols that are commonly run on TCP/IP, such as FTP, SMTP, Telnet, DNS, POP, and so on.\",\\n\"The military forged strong links with large corporations and universities, leading to the creation of NSFNET (National Science Foundation NETwork) in 1986, which formed the new backbone'), finish_reason='length', logprobs=None)] usage=UsageInfo(prompt_tokens=965, total_tokens=1165, completion_tokens=200)\n"
